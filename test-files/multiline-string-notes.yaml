    Perks
    -----

    **Perceptive (2):** The GM may reveal small clues to you that others
    would miss. Once per session a character may announce they are
    studying an object or situation and the GM may reveal something
    that would be impossible for a normal character to determine. If
    nothing is revealed this perk may be used again. “Elementary, my
    dear Watson.”

    **Recall (1):** Any time the character chooses to recall anything he
    has experienced, the GM must tell him the truth in as much detail
    as the character would have been aware.
