Perks
.....

**Perceptive (2):** The GM may reveal small clues to you that others
would miss. Once per session a character may announce they are
studying an object or situation and the GM may reveal something
that would be impossible for a normal character to determine. If
nothing is revealed this perk may be used again. “Elementary, my
dear Watson.”

**Recall (1):** Any time the character chooses to recall anything he
has experienced, the GM must tell him the truth in as much detail
as the character would have been aware.
